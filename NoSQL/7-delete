// Delete documents in the collection school with name="Holberton school"
var result = db.school.remove({ name: "Holberton school" });

// Check if any documents were deleted
if (result.deletedCount === undefined) {
    // Handle the case where the 'deletedCount' property is not present
    print({ acknowledged: false, deletedCount: 0 });
} else {
    print(result);
}
